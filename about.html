        <p><b>With due respect</b>, I am Adnan Khan.</p>
        <p>I live in Pakistan in a middle class family. In my teen I got a facial disease which
            affected my life very badly and limit me just to my home.
            I was already damaged, broken and wounded but <b>nature is cruel</b> and it wanted to give
            me some more, and then I got anexity problems. Which leaved me of nothing. But in all those
            circumstances I worked, I worked really really hard to learn Computer Programming. And I did it!
            I have a good sense of humor. I am trying not to hurt people both physically and verbally.
            Instead I try to detract myself as much as I can from humans as they create problems and I am
            not very good at handling problems as I am already broken.</p>
            <p>I want to uncover Nature, God!</p>
